# JAYG - Just Another Youtube-dl GUI
![JAYD preview](https://github.com/francescodedomenico/JAYG/blob/master/images/preview.png?raw=true)
## Introduction
JAYG is a GUI for [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/) and released under the [Apache 2.0 licence](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). It can download videos and
extract audio from [many popular websites](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html)! JAYG is written in C# and relies on few amazing frameworks (that are enlisted below).
This project is completely open source, you can see how it's made and you can help me making it awesome!
My intention is to create a tool with the KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) philosophy, maybe in the future I'll consider adding a basic and an advanced mode.
## Before you get started
This software has been tested on a Windows 10 machine, but I'm confident that any Windows machine that is able to run the [.NET Framework 4.5.2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=42642) would make this piece of software work.
Additionally you will need the [Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=5555) that is needed to run the youtube-dl executable.
You can build this software by your own using [Microsoft Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/older-downloads/).
Once you've compiled the solution, create a bin folder in the same directory where JAYG.exe is and place the [youtube-dl.exe](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/download.html) and the [ffmpeg.exe](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/) inside.
