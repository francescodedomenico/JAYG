# JAYG - Just Another Youtube-dl GUI
![JAYD preview](https://github.com/francescodedomenico/JAYG/blob/master/images/preview.png?raw=true)
## Introduction
JAYG is a GUI for [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/) and released under the [Apache 2.0 licence](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). It can download videos and
extract audio from [many popular websites](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html)! JAYG is written in C# and relies on few amazing frameworks (that are enlisted below).
This project is completely open source, you can see how it's made and you can help me making it awesome!
My intention is to create a tool with the KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) philosophy, maybe in the future I'll consider adding a basic and an advanced mode.
